This alarm app allows the creation and deletion of multiple alarms at once. By defining the times of the first and last alarms and the length of time between alarms, users can set alarms to go off every _x_ minutes. It was inspired by the simple need to use alarms to keep track of how much time has passed while completing my work, doing my morning routine, or engaging in hyperfocus mode. The demand for something like this -- something superior to using the snooze button or setting timers -- has also been confirmed through direct probing. 

This has so far been a good opportunity to learn UI/UX design using Material3, app lifecycle management, clean architecture, MVVM, working with background services and Android broadcasts, asynchronous operations without blocking UI/UX flow, notification workflows, and much more. It has evolved beyond what I anticipated and become something more substantial and ambitious which is still under active development.
